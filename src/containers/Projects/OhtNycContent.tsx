        I designed and developed a landing page to promote the launch of
        88rising&apos;s first collection with OHT NYC, featuring an exclusive
        interview with their CEO to drive the story behind the collection.

        Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams across both
        organizations to bring their shared creative vision to life in alignment
        with their business objectives, I implemented engaging customer
        touchpoints to enhance brand identity, brand engagement, brand
        visibility, and ultimately drive sales conversions.

        To further enrich the narrative, I strategically embedded Instagram
        posts, leveraging social proof to bolster authenticity, credibility, and
        brand engagement. In addition, I designed, engineered, and integrated
        custom carousel components to showcase the collection through
        editorial-style photography, recreating the traditional print lookbook
        experience into a more immersive, mobile-friendly, digital format,
        integrating direct links to product pages to facilitate a seamless
        customer journey from inspiration to purchase.
