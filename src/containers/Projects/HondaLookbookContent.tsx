        I designed and developed a digital lookbook to promote 88rising&apos;s
        latest collection in collaboration with Honda. Reimagining the
        traditional, print fashion lookbook in the modern web, I created a
        custom image carousel to showcase the collection through stylized
        photography with interactive hotspots directly linking to product pages
        to enhance user engagement, streamline site navigation, and increase
        sales conversions, ultimately delivering a contemporary, immersive
        shoppable catalog experience.
