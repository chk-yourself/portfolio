        Leveraging advanced JavaScript features, modern Web APIs, and creative
        problem-solving, I engineered innovative, cost-effective solutions,
        navigating around challenging Shopify constraints to implement advanced
        features, including:

      <ul className="my-4 list-disc px-8 text-xs">
        <li>geolocation-based content customization</li>
        <li>
          granular content access control based on configurable authentication
          rules
        </li>
        <li>product variant picker</li>
        <li>shoppable image hotspots</li>
        <li>automated scheduled content updates</li>
        <li>loyalty program integration</li>

        teams, I integrated these features, ensuring seamless, intuitive
        customization and implementation without the need for coding knowledge,
        creating comprehensive user guides to further enhance cross-functional
        collaboration and overall operational efficiency.
